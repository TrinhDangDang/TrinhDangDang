Good day beans. I am a computer science major student, i wasn't aware of how vast this major can be until recently, which is unfortunate. after discovering CS's vast domains I decided to go with web development, I am currently exploring web development on my own, both front end and back end, following online tutorials and youtube videos. It would be awsome to get professional experience in any CS domains, lacking real work experiences limits my understanding of this field, i do want to explores all of the computer science related jobs to discover my options. I am such a forgetful student but always ready to explore new concepts and snatch whatever oppotunities that come my way. all helps are appreciated. thankiuuuu
